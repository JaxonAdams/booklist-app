# ReactJS Booklist App
## Description
This is a very simple booklist app I have built to test myself on the fundamentals of React. It uses the Context API to add to and remove from the list of books. The list will not save between sessions, but I may add that functionality in the future. I mostly did this for myself, but I am happy with the result.
